### Simple Carbon Emissions Tracker
This is a very simple program that has the function of calculating and recording your carbon emissions based on the type of vehicle and the distance traveled. In addition, this program also provides information on how long it takes for a type of tree to absorb the carbon emissions that have been created with the hope that this program can increase user awareness of the importance of minimizing the creation of carbon emissions that have a direct impact on global climate change in accordance with the 13th goal of the SDGs: Climate Action.

This program is written in Python and uses CLI as its interface. This program is a final semester group project assignment for the Computer Programming Practicum course.

The success of creating this program is the result of good synergy and cooperation from each team member led by Yasmin, designed by Inno, written by Bima and Zikra, and guaranteed by Dafa.
