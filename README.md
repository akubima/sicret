# SICRET
### Simple Carbon Emissions Tracker
This is a very simple program that has the function to calculate and record your carbon emissions based on the type of vehicle and the distance traveled. In addition, this program also provides information on how many trees are needed of a certain type to absorb carbon emissions produced within 24 hours with the hope that this program can increase user awareness of the importance of minimizing the creation of carbon emissions that have a direct impact on global climate change in accordance with the 13th goal of the SDGs: Climate Action.

This program is written in Python and uses CLI as its interface. This program is a final semester group project assignment for the Computer Programming Practicum course.
